# Iris-Flower-Classification-Dataset-main
 My objective for this project was to develop a classification model capable of accurately predile format for model training. The project commenced with loading and exploring the dataset to gain a comprehensive understanding of the data. By examining the dataset's structure, statistical characteristics, and any missing values, I gained valuable insights that aided in subsequent analysis.

Next, I focused on data preprocessing. This step involved cleaning the data, addressing any missing or erroneous values, and transforming it into a suitable format for model training. Additionally, I split the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance accurately.
